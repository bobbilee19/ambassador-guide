# Event Budget üí∞

This document outlines the budget requirements for all chapter activities. Please make sure you read the [expense guidelines](./expenses.md) before proceeding.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- We use the USD currency as a benchmark for the budget estimates, but your budget for each event will be prepared first in your local currency.
- Every chapter will host a minimum of three **campaign-based events** (one virtual and two physical) every year, including the OSFX.
- You are allowed to host as many virtual events as you desire and your community needs.
- You can host more physical events beyond what OSCA is able to fund each year if you're able to secure partners to make it happen.
- The OSFX (Open Source Festival Extended) events will only happen if the Open Source Festival happens that year and is subject to available funding.
- For all virtual events, we spend only on internet costs for the host (if and where needed‚Äî**please do not request this if you do not need it**).
- On average for all physical events, we spend on a one-time banner, food, stickers, logistics, and conditional venue (all with expected max. numbers).
- The chapter's campaign events budget will vary per group size, as described in the sections below.

## Event Groups

These are the categories of events by estimated number of attendees for each chapter activity:

- **20G** (Group of 20 attendees).
- **50G** (Group of 50 attendees).
- **100G** (Group of 100 attendees).

## Type of Events
