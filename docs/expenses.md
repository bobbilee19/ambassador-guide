# Expense Guidelines üßæ

At Open Source Community Africa, we are transparent and manage all processes of expenses and sponsorships via our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/osca). You are not allowed to create anything new for your financing. All you need to do is keep records of your expenses and submit them accordingly. Suppose you need to receive sponsorship from external entities; you can receive it in your personal bank account (keep receipts and report to your community manager about this) or contact your community manager for details about receiving through the Collective.

All expenses must be approved **before** the event. Expenses not approved before spending will not be reimbursed.

## What Can Be Sponsored?

Open Source Community Africa will sponsor or reimburse a Chapter Lead for approved costs associated with a relevant activity. This could include:

- Small costs of running an event (e.g., light refreshments or logistics).
- Reusable materials for multiple events (e.g., a roll-up banner).

Kindly check the [event budget](./event-budget.md) document to see the list of approved budget items and their costs.

## Getting Approval for a Sponsorship

Before your expense is approved, an estimate must be provided. However, this estimate does not have to be exact but should be a good approximation of the cost. Kindly use [this budget template](https://bit.ly/3SmTFQa) as a guide to preparing your budget estimate in your local currency.

> For Non-Nigerians, please prepare your budget invoice in your local currency and USD using the exchange rate that correlates with your local withdrawal method (e.g., PayPal).

Once you have worked out an estimate of the cost and prepared a budget, include it when you fill out the sponsorship request form in the event issue template. OSCA's Finance or Community Manager will then comment to approve or ask further questions.

## Sponsorship Note

It's important to remember that the budget available for sponsorship is limited and you should do your best to use it responsibly. Help us help you by spending responsibly. **Please note that we need 21 days' notice at maximum to provide any form of sponsorship**.

Expenses will be paid to your local bank, other accepted payment methods (for non-Nigerians), or reimbursed via [Open Collective](hhttps://opencollective.com/osca/projects/osca-community). Once your expense has been approved, OSCA's Finance or Community Manager will communicate the estimated time of arrival of the funds. When you make purchases, ensure to keep all receipts and valid proof of purchase. You will need them to follow the steps in the next section.

## Expenses Report

After your event, you need to log all expenses made alongside your post-event report. You will need access to the [expenses folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12nmfXKsLdxx0bDPmIf_xOaylP82aEbZs?usp=sharing) on Google Drive and the [expense log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OXQcCQ3FDHxbxTb-796xf1yPVuF3ipDP8g7UcbaLmm8/edit?usp=sharing) on Google Spreadsheets. Kindly contact _Bolaji#3828_ or _Edidiong#5608_ on [Discord](https://oscafrica.org/discord) to request access. Kindly follow the steps below to submit your expense report:

1. Ensure your event issue is open at https://github.com/oscafrica/chapter-leads-hub.
2. Ensure your expense request is approved.
3. Keep all receipts and proof of purchases.
4. Create a new folder in this [expenses folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12nmfXKsLdxx0bDPmIf_xOaylP82aEbZs?usp=sharing) with your chapter name (e.g., OSCA Kumasi).
5. For each event, create a new folder in the chapter folder created above with the title format: **YOUR CHAPTER NAME - DATE OF EVENT**
6. Upload all receipts to the folder you created with the title format: **YOUR NAME - MERCHANT NAME - DATE OF PURCHASE**
7. Fill out a row in this [expense log document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OXQcCQ3FDHxbxTb-796xf1yPVuF3ipDP8g7UcbaLmm8/edit?usp=sharing).
