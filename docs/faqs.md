# FAQs

## Do I need to finish every quest?
No. Choose the ones that fit your skills and interests.

## How often will you be adding new quests?
At this time we will not be adding additional quests until Phase 1 launch of the public ambassador program. We will notify you if we add any additional quests.

## How will I know if I moved tiers?
Once you reach the points required to unlock the next tier, our team will be notified. We will send you a detailed email with next steps!

## What if I get busy and cannot keep up? Will I be downgraded to a lower tier?
No. Once you achieve a tier you will remain in that tier until we launch the next phase of the ambassador program (approx 6 months) However, you may be removed from the program if you miss more than two consecutive monthly ambassador meetings and/or reporting requests. If you know you will be busy and need a short leave of absence, please let us know as soon as possible and we will pause report request notifications.

## How many points do I need to maintain to stay in the ambassador program?
We require all ambassadors to gain a minimum of **500 points** by December 1st to remain in the program. SAMSON CHECK THIS

## How long will Phase 0 last?
Six months. At the end of Phase 0 we will reset points in preparation for the official launch of Midnight Aliit.

## Why am I not getting a badge on Discord even though I am Aliit and have moved tiers?
We are in private beta with the ambassador program until November (Midnight Summit). We do not want to expose your name publicly before we announce all Aliit members in November.

## I already earned Zealy points on the public Midnight Network Zealy board. What happens now?
Those points stay on the public board and are not transferrable. After you join the Ambassador board, please stop doing quests on the public board and earn points in the Ambassador board only. To keep things fair for everyone, we count **net new** work completed in this board and do not duplicate points between boards.
