# Monthly Meeting and Report Guide

| [Submit Monthly Report](/.monthly-report-template.md) |

Every month we will connect with you to support your journey, celebrate wins, share upcoming opportunities, and collect a few simple numbers that help us recognize your impact. Each month we will send a monthly metrics form to fill out and host an ambassador board meeting with all current Aliit members.

## What We Will Ask From You
We track your activities in Zealy, but we cannot see detailed stats like attendee counts or content metrics. That is why we will ask you to share those numbers each month so we can capture and highlight your impact.

*Note:* We know life gets busy and some numbers are tough to track. Rough estimates are fine. Sharing this info is not required, but it is very helpful and always appreciated.
