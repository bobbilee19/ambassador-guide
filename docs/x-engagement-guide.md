# X Engagement Guide

## Tagging & Brand Mentions
- Always tag the official Midnight Network handles: **@MidnightNtwrk**, **@midnightfdn** and use the hashtag **#MidnightNetwork** in all posts.  
- This improves visibility and enables cross-promotion.

## Tone & Voice Guidelines for Engineering / Dev Audiences
- Be clear and technical without heavy jargon. Explain nuanced concepts, but prioritize clarity.
- Adopt Midnight’s tone: **helpful, accurate, developer-first**.
- Avoid controversial topics, politics, or unsupported speculation. If unsure, check with the communications team before publishing.

## Tips for Higher Engagement & Reposts
1. **Include a call to action (CTA).**  
   Encourage readers to react, copy the demo repo, repost, or comment their experience. Simple prompts boost interaction.
2. **Use visuals and snippets.**  
   Images, short code snippets, or GIFs increase recall and shareability.
3. **Time your posts.**  
   Post during developer-active hours (for example 11:00–13:00 UTC or 16:00–18:00 local dev time). Align posts with relevant event hashtags (for example `#Devcon`).
4. **Engage with replies.**  
   Ask a question (“Which language did you build this in?”) and respond to comments or mentions to help the algorithm surface your post.
5. **Showcase developer stories.**  
   Share real-world experiences, problems solved, metrics, and lessons learned. Authentic, helpful content outperforms polished marketing.

## Don’ts & Risk Management
- **Review the Code of Conduct and NDA** before tweeting about Midnight.
- Do not misrepresent Midnight or make unsupported claims. Transparency builds trust.
- Do not share proprietary or unreleased product information. If unsure, ask DevRel internally before posting.
- For regions like the United States, avoid financial or dealer-style claims without proper FTC disclosures. Be transparent about any promotional materials.
