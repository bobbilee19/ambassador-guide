# Zealy / Points

We use Zealy to track activities, reward contributions, and celebrate your impact. This guide explains how to use Zealy as a participant.

## 1) Getting Started
- **Join:** Sign up for Zealy and join the private **[Midnight Aliit Ambassador](https://zealy.io/cw/midnightaliit/invite/EjYw8-Y0XsaehPz3XzdXT)** community.
- **Profile setup:** Link your Discord and X accounts so eligible quests can auto-verify.

## 2) Completing Quests
- **Quest categories:** Choose any quests across four categories:
  - Community Engagement
  - Builder Contributions
  - Hackathon and Event Support
  - Content / Advocacy
- **How to complete:** Click a quest to read the instructions and submit the required proof.
- **Locked quests:** If a quest shows as “locked,” click into it to see the prerequisite quest(s) you must finish to unlock it.
- **Verification:** Some quests verify automatically (for example, following on X, joining Discord). Others require manual review (for example, posting a screenshot, link, or brief write-up).
- **How many times can I claim XP?** Some quests are **one-time** (for example, following on X, joining Discord/forums). Most can be completed **multiple times**.

## 3) Rewards and Recognition
- **Tiers and rewards:** Collecting points unlocks new tiers (after Midnight’s review), rewards, and opportunities as listed in the rewards column of the Aliit overview doc LINK HERE.
- **How do I move tiers?** The Midnight team monitors ambassador activity in Zealy. When you have enough points to level up, we will:
  - Update your **Discord badge**  
    *(Aliit Discord badges will not be visible until November, after Midnight Summit.)*
  - Send you an **email** explaining your new benefits
  - Send your **NFT** to the wallet address you provided in your application  
    *(If your wallet address has changed since you applied, please let us know as soon as possible.)*
