# Event Expense Guide ðŸ§¾

| [EVENT INVOICE TEMPLATE](/docs/event-invoice-template.md) |

All expenses you'd like to get reiumbursed must be approved **before** the event. Expenses not approved before spending will not be reimbursed.

## Meetup Expenses

Approved expenses include:
- Small costs of running an event (e.g., pizza / basic (non-premium) catering, non-alcoholic beverages,  or logistics).
- Reusable materials for multiple events (e.g., a roll-up banner).

### Getting Approval for Expenses

Before your expense is approved, an estimate must be provided during your event request submission process. This estimate does not have to be exact but should be a good approximation of the costs you're expecting to be associated with your meetup.

It's important to remember that the budget available for running ambassador meetups is limited and you should do your best to use it responsibly. Help us help you by spending responsibly. **Please note that we need at least 3 weeks notice minimum to provide any form of funding**.

Expenses will be paid to your local bank, other accepted payment methods requested. Once your expense has been approved, Midnight will communicate the estimated time of arrival of the funds. When you make purchases, ensure to keep all receipts and valid proof of purchase. You will need them to follow the steps in the next section.

### Expense Report

Before, during, and after your event, log all expenses and receipts / proof of purchase.

#### How to submit your expense report:
1. Ensure your event issue is open at (SAMSON: I don't get this part from your example repo, PLEASE FILL OUT THIS SECTION WHILE IM GONE)
2. Ensure your expense request is approved.
3. Keep all receipts and proof of purchases.
4. Create a new folder in this [expenses folder](link to come) with your **MEETUP LOCATION NAME - FIRST NAME**.

7. Create an invoice using the [EVENT INVOICE TEMPLATE](/docs/event-invoice-template.md). In this template it'll ask for a link your reciept folder you just created. SAMSON - now do they submit a PR for this invoice template?

## Speaking Expenses

### Does Midnight cover hotel, flight, food, transportation to/from airport?
When an event is not reachable by car or train and you believe Midnight should be represented and there is no alternative near your primary residence use [this template to submit your request to speak](/docs/event-request-template.md)

## Do you have a set stipend limit I should be aware of?
No. During your event request submission process we will ask what you estimate it will cost to cover your hotel, flights, taxi to/from airport, and food per day. This estimate does not have to be exact but should be a good approximation of the costs you're expecting to be associated with speaking at a conference/hack/meetup.

## My expenses have been approved now what?
