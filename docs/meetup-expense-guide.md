# Meetup Expense Guide ðŸ§¾

| [EVENT INVOICE TEMPLATE](/docs/event-invoice-template.md) |

All expenses you'd like to get reiumbursed must be approved **before** the event. Expenses not approved before spending will not be reimbursed.

Approved expenses include:
- Small costs of running an event (e.g., pizza / basic (non-premium) catering, non-alcoholic beverages,  or logistics).
- Reusable materials for multiple events (e.g., a roll-up banner).

## Getting Approval for Expenses

Before your expense is approved, an estimate must be provided during your event request submission process. This estimate does not have to be exact but should be a good approximation of the costs you're expecting to be associated with your meetup.

It's important to remember that the budget available for running ambassador meetups is limited and you should do your best to use it responsibly. Help us help you by spending responsibly. **Please note that we need at least 3 weeks notice minimum to provide any form of funding**.

Expenses will be paid to your local bank, other accepted payment methods requested. Once your expense has been approved, Midnight will communicate the estimated time of arrival of the funds. When you make purchases, ensure to keep all receipts and valid proof of purchase. You will need them to follow the steps in the next section.
