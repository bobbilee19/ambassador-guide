### Speaking at an Event Expenses

⚠️ **Local First!** Look for conferences, meetups, or hackathons near your primary address that you can **drive** or **take a train** to.

If the event is within drive or train distance:
  - Midnight will reumburse you for your **dinner**, **train ticket**, or **gas** for driving (expense estimate required in event request template, and itemized receipts required for all expenses)

If you cannot find local speaking opportunities and the event requires travel:
  - We will consider covering the following, subject to approval in your event request:
    - **Hotel**
    - **Flight**
    - **Food** for the event days
    - **Taxi** to and from the airport
  - **Speaking fees are not paid** (no honoraria)

> It is important to remember that the budget available for ambassador travel is limited. Please spend responsibly.

## Getting Approval
1. Include an **expense estimate** in your event request (hotel, flights, taxis, food, or meetup food and basic logistics). It does not need to be exact but should be a good approximation.
2. Wait for explicit **approval** before spending.
3. Keep your planned costs within what was approved unless you re-confirm changes.

## How to Submit Your Expense Report

1. Confirm your expense request was **approved**.
2. Keep **all** receipts and proof of purchase.
3. Create a new folder inside the **expenses** folder (link coming soon) using:
   - **Meetup:** `MEETUP-LOCATION_FIRSTNAME`
   - **Conference:** `CONFERENCE-NAME_FIRSTNAME`
4. Inside that folder, create a subfolder for the event date:
   - `YYYY-MM-DD`
5. Add a `receipts/` subfolder and upload files named like:
   - `FOOD_2025-10-03.pdf`
   - `BEV_2025-10-03.jpg`
   - `GAS_2025-10-03.png`
   - `TRAIN_2025-10-03.pdf`
   - `HOTEL_2025-10-04.pdf`
   - `FLIGHT_2025-10-04.pdf`
   - `TAXI_2025-10-04.jpg`
6. Create your invoice from the template and place it at the event folder root:
   - `/expenses/MEETUP-LOCATION_FIRSTNAME/YYYY-MM-DD/invoice.md`
7. In the invoice, include a link to the `receipts/` subfolder.
8. Submit for review:
   - **Preferred:** open a **Pull Request** that adds your expense folder and files
   - Add a short description and tag the reviewer
9. If you do not hear back, ping **Samson** on Discord:
   - **Meetups:** after **72 hours**
   - **Speaking travel:** after **1 week**

### Folder and File Naming
- Folder: `MEETUP-LOCATION_FIRSTNAME` or `CONFERENCE-NAME_FIRSTNAME`
- Event subfolder: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Receipts: `CATEGORY_YYYY-MM-DD.ext`
- Invoice: `invoice.md`

### Invoice
Use the template: [EVENT INVOICE TEMPLATE](/docs/event-invoice-template.md)  
Paste the path or link to your `receipts/` folder in the invoice.

### Receipts and Proof of Purchase
- Required for **every** reimbursable item
- Must show vendor, date, amount, and payment confirmation
- Screenshots are acceptable if they clearly show purchase details

## Quick Decision Guide

- Hosting a local meetup you can drive or take the train to  
  → Submit request → if approved, buy **food and non-alcoholic beverages** and basic supplies → invoice with receipts

- Speaking at an event within drive or train distance  
  → Submit request → if approved, claim **dinner**, **train ticket**, or **gas** → invoice with receipts

- Speaking at an event that requires flight and hotel, after exhausting local options  
  → Submit request with estimates → if approved, you **book on your own card** → after the event, invoice for **hotel**, **flight**, **food for days of the event**, and **taxi to and from airport** (no speaking fees)

## Open Items
- Link to the central **expenses** folder (TBD)
- Confirm PR is the final submission method for invoices
