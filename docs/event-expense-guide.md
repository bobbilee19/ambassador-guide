### Speaking at an Event

‚ö†Ô∏è **Local First!** Look for conferences, meetups, or hackathons near your primary address that you can **drive** or **take a train** to. Budget available for ambassador travel is limited. Please spend responsibly.

If the event is within drive or train distance:
  - Midnight will reumburse you for your **dinner**, **train ticket**, or **gas** for driving

If you cannot find a local speaking opportunity and/or the event requires travel, here are expenses you may request and are subject to approval:
 - **Conference / Hackathon registration**
 - **Hotel**
 - **Flights**
 - **Food** for the event days
 - **Taxi/Uber** to and from the airport only

## Getting Approval

1. Include an **expense estimate** in your event request (hotel, flights, taxis, daily meal costs for yourself, meetup food and non-alcholic bev).
2. Wait for explicit **approval** before spending any money / booking anything.
3. Keep your planned costs within what was approved unless you re-confirm changes.
4. Stay organized and make sure all of your receipts are itemized (e.g. sharing all things included in your dinner order not just the total bill)
