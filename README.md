Welcome to Midnight Aliit!

You‚Äôre part of a very small, exclusive first cohort selected for the unique value you bring to the Midnight ecosystem and we‚Äôre thrilled to have you as part of this founding group. Let‚Äôs build the future, together.

## How to Get Started

All ambassador activity is tracked in our questing platform, Zealy. There you can:
- Browse contribution opportunities
- Earn points for your work
- Track your tier progress in real time

As you participate, you‚Äôll unlock rewards across four areas of contribution:
- Educate: Share Midnight‚Äôs technology through talks, workshops, and content
- Advocate: Represent our mission and explain the importance of privacy to developers
- Engage: Host events and introduce new developers to the ecosystem
- Contribute: Build projects, give product feedback, and support community growth

## Important Program and Zealy Guidelines

**Zealy Point Transfer Guidelines:**
- Public Zealy Board (before you join the program):
-- If you earned points on the public board, those points do not transfer automatically.
-- If you see the same quest on the ambassador board, you may resubmit your previous answers once, and we will give you credit for them.
- Private Ambassador Zealy Board (after you join):
-- Going forward, all quests and points must be completed in the ambassador board only.
-- You may not duplicate points for new quests that appear in both boards after you‚Äôve joined.

**Phase 0 Privacy Until Midnight Summit / November 2025:** Please keep your membership in Aliit strictly confidential until the Midnight Summit (November 17-19, 2025), when the program will be officially announced.

**Phase 1 Reset:** In 6 months, all of your Zealy XP points will reset as we prepare for the official launch of Midnight Aliit, the official yearly ambassador program that will run approximately from March 2026 - March 2027.

**Check-Ins:** Ambassadors are expected to submit a monthly check-in report. Missing two in a row without communication will result in removal from the program.

**Pausing & Eligibility:** Aliit members are required to have at least 500 points by January 15, 2025 to stay in the program. We understand life happens, if you need to step back temporarily, let us know as soon as possible. Your tier won‚Äôt be downgraded; you‚Äôll simply be marked as ‚ÄúInactive,‚Äù with your contributions celebrated as an Aliit alumni. You‚Äôll always have an open door to rejoin a future cohort.
