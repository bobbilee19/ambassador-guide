## Submitting Event Requests

Here's an example of how to submit a request. Let's say you want to host a workshop on "Building Open Source Projects" for your chapter in Lagos State, Nigeria, you will do the following:

<details>
  <summary>🎖 Open an Issue</summary>
  <br />

  You will open an issue titled *"Building Open Source Projects | Lagos | 2021/10/13"*, and describe what you're planning to do as requested in the issue template. PLEASE DELETE ALL AND ONLY THE COMMENTS/QUOTES BELOW BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR ISSUE (quotes started with **>** in the template).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>🏷 Add Lables</summary>
  <br />

  You will then add the compulsory labels "Lagos" (Your City), "Nigeria" (Your Country), and "Workshop" (Event Type), alongside any other optional related tag(s). See all tags [here](https://github.com/oscafrica/chapter-leads-hub/labels).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>⏳ Review and Feedback</summary>
  <br />

  A community manager (Edidiong or Bolaji) will respond to your request. Once reviewed, your event will be approved, or rejected, or some feedback will be shared for changes.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>📦 Request Processing</summary>
  <br />

  If you request for financial sponsorship, we will begin processing the request through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/osca) or local systems available. We will aim to get the approved amount across before your event date.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>🗣 Publicize the Event</summary>
  <br />

  Once your event is approved, create a banner for your event using the design guidelines (if you don't have one already), create an RSVP page with which you will collect important information from your attendees before the event, and share both with the global/local OSCA community on Discord and social media.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>🎊 Host the Event!</summary>
  <br />

  Now you can proceed to host the workshop.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>📜 Submit Your Event Report</summary>
  <br />
  
  After the event is completed, return to the created issue and submit a post-event report. Your report should include photos, relevant social media posts, reports, and any other details. To create the post-event report, use the [Post Event Template](/docs/post-event-template.md), submit the report as a comment under the issue, and submit any expenses by following the [Expenses Guidelines](/docs/expenses.md).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>✅ The Issue Will Be Closed</summary>
  <br />

  You have done well, mission complete!
